        <h2>My Recipes</h2>
        <p>This website contains 3 of the most exquisite dishes known to human kind. Each dish is prepared from a different meat - fish, chicken and beef. It is a guarantee that if these dishes are cooked and placed on the table, no human (exception vegans and vegetarians) could resist their gluttony. These recipes are carefully made with utmost attention to detail. The selection of each ingredient, the quantity of those ingredients added and the process of preparing/cooking them together were crystallised after millions of trials throughout generations. Please be faithful to each word on these recipes. One tablespoon of onions means just one tablespoon of onions not even 1.00000000001 or 0.999999999998 tablespoon of onions. Same is the case with heating, each fraction of degree of a centigrade is as important as one 100 centigrade. Attempt to cook these recipes, only if you can, with full confidence, prepare it, abiding by the directions word for word. Any deviation is a digrace to the food, the ancestors who toiled all their villages in tiny villages and most importantly to your tongue.<br><br>Recipes are:<br></p>
